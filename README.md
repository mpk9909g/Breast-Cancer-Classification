Apply machine learning to classify benign or malignant breast cancer tumors 

Data preprocessing notebook includes data cleaning, feature selection and splitting the data into train and test sets. 

We used 2 different input feature groups for this data. 
  
1. First group includes all of the features from the data.
1. Second group includes only top 15 features that were selected based on PCA analysis.

Train and test data files for group 1  are ```X_train_scaled.csv``` and ```X_test_scaled.csv``` respectively.
Scaler file for group 1 is ```scaler_allfeatures.sav``` 

Train and test data files for group 2  are ```X_train_scaled_pca.csv``` and ```X_test_scaled_pca.csv``` respectively.
Scaler file for group 2 is ```scaler_features_removed.sav```
